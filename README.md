# Mirror (Spring 2019 - Group Game Project)

This is the group project I worked on in the GIMM 250 class of Spring 2019.
The other contributors to this project are:
+ Alex Becerril
+ Caleb Cram
+ Cole Rene
+ Sydney Wayne-Riddle
+ Hannah Wiles

The initial commit of this project will contain the code in the state it was when it was turned in.

Any code changes afterwards will only be in the interest of maintaining compatability with recent
Flash Player and Adobe Animate versions.

The project requires the Starling library. Just drop "starling.swc" into the root folder and it should run.
